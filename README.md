# Classification of poisonous or edible mushrooms

This notebook presents a model for classifying mushrooms as poisonous or edible. The dataset used is composed of information about various characteristics of the mushrooms, such as shape, color, odor, as well as information about whether the mushroom is poisonous or not.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this notebook was obtained through Kaggle and contains information on poisonous and edible mushrooms. It consists of 8124 samples and 23 attributes, including the mushroom class (poisonous or edible), available at https://www.kaggle.com/code/micaeld/poisonous-mushrooms-predict.

## Exploratory data analysis
Initially, I performed an exploratory analysis of the data to understand the distribution of classes and the relationship between the different variables in the dataset. I then performed a data cleanup and prepared it for model training.

## Model training
I used a decision tree to classify the mushrooms. The model was trained with the training data and validated with the test data. The model accuracy reached 100%, which indicates a perfect performance in the classification task.

## Results
The trained model can be used to classify mushrooms as poisonous or edible with high accuracy. This can be useful for people who want to collect mushrooms for their own consumption or for businesses that sell edible mushrooms.
